Copperhead Compiler
--------------------------------
The Copperhead compiler is a data parallel compiler, written in C++,
built to support Copperhead, a data parallel language embedded in Python.
The Copperhead compiler accepts a normalized, typed abstract syntax tree
representing a computation, and generates parallel C++ code which
implements the computation.  By separating the Copperhead compiler from
the Copperhead project itself, we hope to allow the compiler to be used
in other contexts besides Copperhead itself, for example, as a supporting
compiler for other domain specific and/or embedded languages.
